# Study of Assortativity in a Network of Medicines and Active Ingredients

Student: Lucas Freire Costa

Course: Computer Engineering

Network #01

## Co-occurrence of Active Ingredients among Medications

- Nodes (vertices): Each medication is represented by a node.

- Edges: An edge exists between two medications if they share at least one active ingredient.

- Assortativity: Calculate the assortativity based on the regulatory category of the medications.

## Question to be answered:

- Do medications in the same regulatory category tend to share active ingredients?

Answer: Based on the assortativity calculation, it can be stated that they do not.
