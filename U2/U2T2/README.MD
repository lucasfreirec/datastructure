# Performance Analysis of Two Algorithms

The objective of this project is to evaluate the performance of two algorithms using statistical analysis and graphical visualizations. The algorithms under study are `solver_closest` and `solver_kth_largest`, both implemented using the Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure.

Student: Lucas Freire Costa

Course: Computer Engineering

## Notebook Structure and Step-by-Step Description

### 1. Environment Setup and Library Import

The notebook starts by importing the necessary libraries, such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy for statistical calculations and plotting graphs. The recursion limit is adjusted to accommodate large data structures.

### 2. Definition of the Algorithms

Two algorithms were defined:

- `solver_closest(tree, target)`: Finds the value in the BST closest to the target value.
- `solver_kth_largest(tree, k)`: Finds the k-th largest value in the BST.

These algorithms use helper functions to traverse the tree and compare values.

### 3. Performance Test Configuration

Parameters were defined for the performance tests:

- `N = 1000000`: Maximum size of the data.
- `steps = 10`: Number of different sizes to be tested.
- `executions_per_size = 10`: Number of executions for each size to obtain average times.

Random data arrays are generated, and the BST is populated accordingly.

### 4. Execution and Timing of the Algorithms

For each size in `vector_sizes`, both algorithms are executed multiple times. Execution times are recorded for statistical analysis.

### 5. Statistical Analysis and Confidence Intervals

- Average execution times are calculated for each algorithm.
- Standard deviations and confidence intervals (95%) are computed using the t-Student distribution.

This provides insights into the variability and reliability of the performance measurements.

### 6. Visualization of Results

Performance results are visualized using Matplotlib:

- Execution times of both algorithms are plotted as a function of data sizes.
- Error bars represent the confidence intervals.
- Customizations include setting axis labels, titles, legends, and grids.

Two versions of the graph are generated with different styles and saved as transparent PNG images.

### 7. Conclusion

The performance evaluation demonstrates how each algorithm scales with the increase in data size. The statistical analysis confirms the consistency of the execution times. The visualizations effectively compare the algorithms, highlighting their efficiency and possible points of attention.
